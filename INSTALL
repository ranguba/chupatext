= How to compile and install

== Install from the source

If you want to use system wide;

  $ tar xpzf chupa-0.1.0.tar.gz
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

By default, installed files will be under /usr/local.

If you want to use privately;

  $ tar xpzf chupa-0.1.0.tar.gz
  $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/opt
  $ make
  $ make install

The path of prefix is arbitrary (as long as you have write
permission).
